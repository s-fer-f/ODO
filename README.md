These codes allow the calculation of the operational diversity order as a function of the average operational received power and its verification by the outage probability, both theoretically calculated and simulated.
It is also provided the calculation of the power increase required to achieve a 1 order of magnitude improvement in the outage probability as a function of the average operational received power.
To validate our results, it is presented a series of stochastic fading channel models examples: Rayleigh fading, Cascaded Rayleigh fading, Rice fading (SISO and SIMO assuming Selection Combining (SC) and Maximal Ratio Combining(MRC)), and Two-Wave with Diffuse Power (TWDP) fading.
